# ENSC-251-Project
In the ENSC 251 project: To design and implement a simplified graduate student admission system 
using the skills learned throughout this course, i.e., Object-Oriented Programming with C++. 
Hopefully you can learn more about the programming skills, as well as how to get into a
graduate program. The project weighs 50 marks, which includes 20 marks for the interim report
and 30 marks for the final presentation. All students need to form a 4-person team to work on the
project and will be evaluated per team (including both individual marks and team marks). Some
general grading logistics have been discussed in Lecture 0 and posted on our course website:
https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/70216/pages/project-logistics.
You can divide the work roughly based on the listed tasks; the overall marks for major tasks are
also listed for your guidance, but not the detailed marks for every single item. Please include a
simple document in the project report indicating which parts each member finished. There is some
negative marking if you don’t complete the listed tasks; details are not listed. Basically, the detailed
grading scheme (except the overall marks for major tasks) for the project will NOT be released
before your project grading is done. Think about you are in a real interview, nobody will tell you
what the detailed grading schemes are.
In this simplified graduate student admission system, we will have a number of domestic and
international students applying to SFU graduate school, each student will be evaluated based on
his/her CGPA, research score, and optional English language testing scores (if the applicant is an
international student). Only the top applicants who satisfy certain criteria will be admitted to SFU
graduate school.
We make some simplifications here. First, for CGPA, we assume all student applicants will use
SFU 4.3 CGPA scale (round to single digit after the decimal point, e.g., 4.33 to 4.3, 3.67 to 3.7).
Second, we simplify the research score to an integer number from 0 to 100 (full score 100). Note
in reality, research score is based on a number of factors, including the applicant’s research
experience, publication, recommendation letters and etc. Third, we assume all international
students need to provide their TOEFL scores for the English language test.
